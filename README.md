# UFOs

## Overview of Project
  * The purpose of this analysis is to test overall knowledge on javascript by creating dynamic content that displays data in a visually appealing and precise manner. The analysis consists of generating data in a webpage and creating filters that accept user input to narrow down the data to user criteria. 


## Results
  * The result of this analysis is a visually appealing webpage capable of accepting user input of various filters to find UFO data from around the world.
  * The challenge of this analysis was incorporating javascript in our HTML code to create a functional webpage.

  * In the webpage, Users may narrow down their search for data from specific fields as such:

  * Filters accept multiple criteria by utilizing functions in our js code that track user input and reflect the changes in the table data:

## Summary
  * A drawback of this webpage is that the input used for filtering only accepts specific text from the table. For example, someone searching for UFO sightings in Texas would have to know to type "tx" instead of "Texas" or any other combination of letters that describe Texas.
  * Further development of this webpage would come in the form of:
   * Generating a function within our filter functions to address the variation that may arise in user input when searching for certain data. 
   * Creating a dropdown of all possible options in each filter in order to facilitate the search in the case that the user does not know exactly what they want to search for. 
  * Overall this challenge was difficult yet very rewarding. The main challenge I encountered was creating the function that was able to take in changes in different filters and return them in the table data. I was able to find many resources such as StackOverflow, YouTube, and coursemates to aid in the final solution.
